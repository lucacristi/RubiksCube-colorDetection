# RubiksCube-colorDetection
-- The project was done in 2019 --

## Objective
- The aim of this application is to detect the colors of a Rubik's cube with the help of the user's webcam.  
- The implementation is done using C++ OpenCV libraries.  
- The data is saved into a dll file, which is later used in Unity.  

## Application Flow

The implementation steps of the application are:
* Start a video stream capture using the webcam;  
* Display of the colorsâ€™ detection spots;  
* Color scanning by double-checking;  
* Transmit colors to Unity;  
* Cube rendering;  
* Display the solving solution by rotating the rendered cube.
